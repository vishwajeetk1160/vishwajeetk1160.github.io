We understand that coming to Japan for the first time can be overwhelming. It can also become confusing because of the language barrier. We are aggregating 
    some information that might help the newcomers. We spent a significant amount of time figuring out things and places when we arrived in Tokyo, newcomers might get 
    some benefit out of it.
